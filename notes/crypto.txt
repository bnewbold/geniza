Like many libsodium wrappers, and apparently *all* reasonable Rust bindings,
sodiumoxcide does not expose the `crypto_stream_xsalsa20_xor_ic` function,
necessary to use libsodium in an endless steam configuration.

TLS is a pain, but if it (or some other standard) was used instead of the
current libsodium, it might be possible in the future to get kernel-mode
encryption going.
