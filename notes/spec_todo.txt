Things that were underspecified in the spec/whitepaper:

- endianness of magic (big-endian)
- uppercase/lowercase of algorithm name (inconsistent in one place)
- what if there is only a single chunk/entry in a register tree? then a leaf
  acts as a root?

"You can use the byteOffset property in the Stat meta- data object to seek into
the right position in the content for the start of this chunk." => unnecessary,
node.js specific?

Clarify: appending to tree SLEEP results in writes into middle of file (for
root nodes). This seems not-great for performance (can't bulk-write). Better to
cache or work in RAM then batch commit?
